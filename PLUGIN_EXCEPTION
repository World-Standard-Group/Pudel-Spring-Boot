Version 1.0 — January 2026

This file is an additional permission under Section 7 of the
GNU Affero General Public License version 3 ("AGPLv3").

All rights reserved.

------------------------------------------------------------

1. PURPOSE

Pudel (the "Program") is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License version 3 or any later version ("AGPLv3").

The copyright holder(s) of the Program hereby grant an additional
permission (the "Pudel Plugin Exception") to clarify the licensing
status of plugins developed for Pudel.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this exception:

- "pudel-core" refers to the core Pudel application licensed under
  the AGPLv3.

- "pudel-api" refers to the public Plugin API / Plugin Development Kit
  provided by the Pudel project for the purpose of developing plugins.

- "Plugin" refers to a separate work that extends or interacts with
  Pudel by using only the public interfaces defined in pudel-api.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. GRANT OF ADDITIONAL PERMISSION

As a special exception, the copyright holder(s) of Pudel grant you
permission to develop, use, copy, modify, and distribute Plugins
under terms of your choice, including proprietary or commercial terms,
provided that all of the following conditions are met:

a) The Plugin interacts with pudel-core solely through the public
   interfaces defined in pudel-api.

b) The Plugin does not include, modify, or derive from any source code
   of pudel-core.

c) The Plugin is loaded, linked, or executed at runtime using any
   plugin or extension mechanism explicitly supported by Pudel.

------------------------------------------------------------

4. DERIVATIVE WORKS CLARIFICATION

A Plugin that satisfies the conditions in Section 3 is NOT considered
a "derivative work" or a "work based on the Program" within the meaning
of the AGPLv3, even if the Plugin:

- Runs in the same Java Virtual Machine process as pudel-core; or
- Communicates with pudel-core via in-process method calls.

Accordingly, such Plugins are not subject to the copyleft requirements
of the AGPLv3.

------------------------------------------------------------

5. SCOPE LIMITATION

This exception applies ONLY to Plugins as defined above.

This exception DOES NOT apply to:

- Modifications of pudel-core itself;
- Forks or derivative works of pudel-core;
- Code that includes or copies source code from pudel-core;
- Distributions of pudel-core with modifications.

All such works remain fully subject to the AGPLv3.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. VERSIONING AND CONTINUITY

This Plugin Exception applies to all versions of pudel-core released
by the copyright holder(s), unless explicitly revoked or modified in
writing.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. RELATIONSHIP TO AGPLv3

This exception supplements, and does not replace, the AGPLv3.
Except as expressly stated herein, all terms of the AGPLv3 continue
to apply without modification.
